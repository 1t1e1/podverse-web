On March 1 2017, Intercepted with Jeremy Scahill released an episode titled "Trump's Kabuki Theater Performance". On March 2, the same episode's title was changed to "Donald in Wonderland". I made a clip of this episode on March 1, and since clips and episodes are not associated in our db, the clip's page still displays the old episode title.
